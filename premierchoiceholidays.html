        <h1>Our Holidays in brief</h1>
            <p>

        <h2><em>Safaris</em></h2>
            <img class="article" src="safari.jpg" alt="Picture of a lion taken on an african safari"/>
                <p>
                    Africa teems with life. Home of the great migration, the Big Five, mountain gorillas and far more,
                    there's nowhere better for a wildlife-watching holiday. In Swahili, the word ‘safari’ means ‘to go
                    on a journey’ and an Africa safari offers a real adventure; the chance to travel deep into true
                    wilderness and stray off the tourist trail. Travel by road, bumping along dusty tracks, taking in
                    the vast, rolling landscapes and spotting wildlife along the way; or take to the skies for
                    spectacular aerial views, flying in to tiny national park airstrips where lions roam the runway.
                    No matter how many wildlife documentaries you’ve seen, nothing can prepare you for the real thing.
                    We know that some guests enjoy a more sociable experience with like-minded travellers, while
                    others love the thrill of an independent adventure, so our luxury safaris are divided into escorted
                    small group safaris and independent tailor-made safaris, where you’ll have your own private
                    driver/guide. Whether this is your first time treading the wilds of Africa, or you fell under its
                    spell many visits ago, we can help you find your dream safari adventure.

        <h2><em>Cruises</em></h2>

            <p>
                With a Premier Choice Holidays cruise, it's the <strong>wow!</strong> factor that seperates us from all
                of the rest We give our guests an upgrade on ordinary, with onboard innovations like robotic waiters,
                sky diving at sea, world class dining and West End style shows, not forgetting astonishingly spacious
                accommodation. These are the moments Where Extraordinary Happens. So, whether you’re a lounge lizard
                or an adrenalin junkie, our cruise holidays can cater to everyone’s idea of extraordinary. We sail to
                over <strong>200</strong> extraordinary destinations around the world. From the warm and inviting
                Mediterranean all the way to majestic Alaska, there’s a holiday to suit your taste. We’re not talking
                about a flying visit either, we actually dock up in our destinations for most of the day; so you’ll get
                the chance to explore and create your own adventures. One of the best things about a Premier Choice
                cruise is that the destinations come to you. Wake up to a new horizon every day, filled with the
                promise of adventure. No unpacking or case-lugging required. Plus, when you’re all explored out, you can
                always take the adventure back to the ship. Whether you want to rest or play, our decks are packed with
                activities, just waiting to be discovered and enjoyed. THE ONLY WAY TO TRAVEL
                The only thing that’s better than our destinations? The ground breaking fleet of 35 state-of-the-art
                cruise ships that will take you there. When you step onto one of our ships, it feels like stepping into
                another world. A world where the ordinary becomes extraordinary; from spacious and innovative rooms to
                award winning cuisine, West End style shows, and skydiving on-board over the endless ocean – real life
                will suddenly seem like a million miles away.

    <h1>Essential Holiday Information</h1>
        <p>
            Passports, visas and immigration requirements: Your specific passport, visa and other immigration
            requirements are your responsibility. We advise that you confirm these with the relevant Embassies and/or
            Consulates well in advance of booking, to avoid any delays on the day of departure. British Citizens will
            need a full 10 year passport to travel to the destinations we feature and are generally required to have
            6 months remaining on it after the scheduled date of return. Children are required to have their own
            passport. The name on your passport must match the name on your ticket, otherwise you may not be able to
            travel or your travel insurance may become invalid. If you or anyone in your party changes their name,
            please contact us immediately so that they can reissue you with a new ticket. An amendment fee will be
            applicable for this service.

            Health and medical advice: Health facilities, hygiene and disease risks vary worldwide. You should take
            health advice about your specific needs as early as possible. Sources of information include the
            following: www.fco.gov.uk (see the “Know Before You Go” section of the website); www.hpa.org.uk;
            www.nathnac.org.uk; your GP; or a specialist clinic. Whilst many Western European destinations
            currently have no compulsory inoculation requirements, advice about destinations can change. Customers
            travelling to other destinations are recommended to seek advice from the sources mentioned above.

            Travel Information: The Foreign and Commonwealth Travel Advice Unit may have issued health and/or safety
            information about your holiday destination. You are advised to check this information by calling
            0845 850 2829 or by visiting the FCO website directly: www.fco.gov.uk. The advice on the FCO website can
            change so check regularly for updates about your specific holiday destination.

            Travel insurance: Premier Choice offers personal travel insurance to cover you whilst on your holiday.
            Customers can purchase a policy on-line via this <a href="https://www.erv.co.uk">link</a> or visiting
            https://www.erv.co.uk. As with all travel insurance policies, ERV Travel Insurance contains certain
            restrictions. In order to qualify for this insurance policy you must be under the age of 76 at the time of
            purchase and be a resident of the European Union. The policy does not cover any pre-existing medical
            conditions. If you are taking any medication, have been hospitalised in the previous 12 month period or are
            under observation or investigation for an undiagnosed medical complaint we advise that you look for a
            specialised insurance policy to ensure you are adequately insured. Please ensure you read the terms and
            conditions of your policy carefully to ensure cover is right for you. Should you feel the policy is not
            right for your needs and you notify us within 14 days of purchase, we will refund the premium to you in
            full subject to travel having not taken place.
