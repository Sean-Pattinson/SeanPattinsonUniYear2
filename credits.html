    <h1>Security Considerations</h1>
    <p>
        With your new website if you are collecting user information such as email addresses or contact details you
        need to make sure that the data is collected and stored securely so that it is not easily obtainable by
        hackers or other unwanted access. Most web applications use standard ports such as port 80 for HTTP or
        port 443 for SSL. Access can also be easily obtained through the exterior firewall this way so it would be
        good practice to ensure there is more than one firewall between the web server and the internal network of the
        company. If data is being passed over the internet from a User it may be a good idea to ensure that it is
        protected by using SSL to transmit the data so it is protected when it is passed over. It may also be a good idea
        to ensure that once data is received it is protected by ensuring that if it is accessed that it is not useful
        to any unwanted parties. This is achievable by encrypting the data you are going to store once it is received
        as this makes the data useless to anyone without the decryption key/cipher. In forms it would be better to use
        POST for actions that change the data and it would also be a good idea to ensure that the data is safe before
        making any changes. In PHP it may be a good idea to use prepared statements to prevent unwanted data being added
        or to prevent data being modified unintentionally or otherwise. It would also be a good idea to educate the users of the system of the ways that hackers may try to gain
        information form them or access to the system through the use of phishing emails or social engineering attacks.
