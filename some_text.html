Macavity's a Mystery Cat: he's called the Hidden Paw—<BR>
For he's the master criminal who can defy the Law.<BR>
He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad's despair:<BR>
For when they reach the scene of crime—Macavity's not there!<BR>
<BR>
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity,<BR>
He's broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity.<BR>
His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare,<BR>
And when you reach the scene of crime—Macavity's not there!<BR>
You may seek him in the basement, you may look up in the air—<BR>
But I tell you once and once again, Macavity's not there!<BR>
<BR>
Macavity's a ginger cat, he's very tall and thin;<BR>
You would know him if you saw him, for his eyes are sunken in.<BR>
His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domed;<BR>
His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed.<BR>
He sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snake;<BR>
And when you think he's half asleep, he's always wide awake.<BR>
<BR>
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity,<BR>
For he's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity.<BR>
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square—<BR>
But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity's not there!<BR>
<BR>
He's outwardly respectable. (They say he cheats at cards.)<BR>
And his footprints are not found in any file of Scotland Yard's<BR>
And when the larder's looted, or the jewel-case is rifled,<BR>
Or when the milk is missing, or another Peke's been stifled,<BR>
Or the greenhouse glass is broken, and the trellis past repair<BR>
Ay, there's the wonder of the thing! Macavity's not there!<BR>
<BR>
And when the Foreign Office find a Treaty's gone astray,<BR>
Or the Admiralty lose some plans and drawings by the way,<BR>
There may be a scrap of paper in the hall or on the stair—<BR>
But it's useless to investigate—Macavity's not there!<BR>
And when the loss has been disclosed, the Secret Service say:<BR>
It must have been Macavity!'—but he's a mile away.<BR>
You'll be sure to find him resting, or a-licking of his thumb;<BR>
Or engaged in doing complicated long division sums.<BR>
<BR>
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity,<BR>
There never was a Cat of such deceitfulness and suavity.<BR>
He always has an alibi, and one or two to spare:<BR>
At whatever time the deed took place—MACAVITY WASN'T THERE !<BR>
And they say that all the Cats whose wicked deeds are widely known<BR>
(I might mention Mungojerrie, I might mention Griddlebone)<BR>
Are nothing more than agents for the Cat who all the time<BR>
Just controls their operations: the Napoleon of Crime!<BR>
