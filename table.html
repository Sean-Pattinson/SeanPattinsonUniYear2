<h3>Tables & DIVs</h3></div>
<div id="content"><p> This layout is faking the kind of layout that is frequently achieved using tables, though this page
    does the same thing using stylesheets and divs. See if you can get this kind of layout but actually
    using tables. Remember to set the border="1" for your table until you've got the layout right and only
    then change to border="0". The key to the layout is correct column and row spanning.</p>

    <table width="100%" border="1">
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="2">
                This column spans two rows, so
                notice in the next row I need
                only define column 2
            </td>
            <td>
                Row one, column two
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                row 2, column 2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="2">
                This column extends
                over two column widths -
                so I only need define one column
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>In the directed-study for this week you're going to do a similar thing using stylesheets with not a
        table in site. Please don't look at the source code, until you've really worked at it for an hour or so.
        You'll learn more that way.</p>
